## Intro

This is an assignment as part of a Frontend Developer role. Built using React, TypeScript and Tailwing with Redux as state management.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Inspiration:

In order to prepare a UI, I did some research. I looked over Pinterest, Google Search and a site called uidesigndaily and few others. Since I already have prior experience with dashboard-related projects, it made the work much easier.

## API Integration

I have used a public api called [Fakestore](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/en) but it has a downside which I figured later. The data changes frequently and sometimes no data would be displayed. In such case, please have a patience and try later.

## State Management

Redux has been used for managing states as requested in assignment.

## Testing

As I don't have a prior experience of any testing library, I could not implement. But definitely I will learn. I did manual QA to be honest.
